## Sounds of Seismic (SOS)

Sounds of Seismic (SOS) is an electronica earthwork that continuously translates real-time seismic data into interpretive musical compositions. This digital symphony merges electronic music synthesis with earth science and data art, presenting multiple browser interfaces that render Earth's vibrational patterns as unique sonic broadcasts. Built with GenAI and open-source web audio standards, SOS transforms complex geophysical data into accessible musical experiences for global audiences. <br>

SOS expands Robert Smithson's site/non-site dialectic into the digital realm. Where Smithson brought geological samples into galleries as "non-sites" referencing distant locations, SOS transforms the entire Internet into a non-site for Earth's seismic activity. The planet becomes the ultimate site-specific digital earthwork, with every tectonic shift contributing to an endless, evolving composition. The Earth is speaking through algorithmic interpretation, creating what may be the first truly planetary-scale artwork.

SOS agents become sonic architects, leveraging decades of historical electroacoustic research and electronica synthesis techniques, to reimagine seismic events as real-time musical compositions. Where traditional sonification merely converts data to sound, SOS creates genuine artistic interpretation, deconstructing seismic events into granular textures, introducing 'electronica attenuation' that mirrors how seismic energy naturally decays through Earth's varied substrates.

### Theoretical Implications

SOS challenges fundamental assumptions about authorship, duration, and site-specificity in contemporary art and science. Who is the artist when Earth provides the data, AI performs the interpretation, and humans experience the result? The work exists in perpetual generation, never complete, always becoming—a durational performance measured in geological rather than human time. SOS constructs what we might call a "planetary non-site"— everywhere Earth moves, the artwork responds, creating a distributed sculpture of pure information and sound.

This project emerges from and contributes to a broader cultural shift in which AI becomes not merely a tool but a medium — a new way of perceiving and interpreting phenomena beyond human sensory or cognitive limits. As photography once revealed what Walter Benjamin called the "optical unconscious", SOS sonification reveals Earth's seismic unconscious, making audible the constant planetary processes that surround us yet remain below the threshold of perception.

SOS explores parallels between geological and biological communication systems. Just as whales communicate across hundreds of miles using infrasound frequencies as low as 10 Hz, and elephants coordinate herds through ground-transmitted vibrations across vast distances, Earth's seismic activity operates in similar ranges—creating planetary communication. The project develops AI translation methods making these geological "conversations" audible to human perception, establishing frequency and vibration as fundamental artistic mediums within Earth's existing communication ecology.

SOS establishes Earth as active collaborator rather than passive subject, marking the moment when human creativity evolved to include geological intelligence as creative partner. SOS pioneers a new paradigm: art that listens to the planet and gives it voice, fundamentally transforming how humanity understands its place within Earth's deep time symphony.
